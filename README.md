According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report from 2018, diabetes is one of the chronic illnesses with the fastest rate of growth that poses a threat to human life and affects 422 million people globally. 
Diabetes always has to be detected early for a clinically meaningful outcome because it has a relatively long asymptomatic phase. 
Due to the disease's protracted asymptomatic period, almost 50% of all diabetics go undetected. Diabetes can only be properly diagnosed in its early stages if the common and less common indicator symptoms are appropriately evaluated. 
These symptoms might appear at various points from the beginning of the disease until the diagnosis. Researchers that are working on illness risk prediction models have found success with data mining categorization techniques. 

To estimate the probability of developing diabetes necessitates a dataset with patient data from people who are newly diagnosed with diabetes or who plan to get diabetes.
I employed a dataset of 520 cases for this study, which was gathered through direct questionnaires given to patients at the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh.
I used the Confusion Matrix, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Kera-Neural Network, and Percentage Split evaluation approaches to examine the dataset. 
The results showed that Random Forest had the best accuracy on this dataset.
Lastly, a widely available, user-friendly tool has been suggested that allows the end user to determine their risk of developing diabetes by evaluating their symptoms and providing helpful advice on how to manage the risk factors.
